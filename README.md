###
## __Notes__
* Since Termux removed Hydra from their repo, you cant install Hydra in Termux anymore. But 
you can still install this in Termux using a different distro like Kali Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu

* This only works on Debian Based Distros.

* If you want to improve this project, just be specific in the Pull Requests.

* Be specific when you open a Issue or it will be closed.
